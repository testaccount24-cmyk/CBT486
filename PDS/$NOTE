As others have said, timer or no timer, run the system with true
GMT/UTC and adjust local time.  Before we had a timer, I wrote a
little program that prompts the operator for *time zone* such as
EDT or CST rather than for actual time, then calculates the
proper value, then issues the SET CLOCK command.  The result is a
pretty accurate rendition of local time with much less chance of
finger check than having to type the command yourself.

Sam Golob, want a copy for the tape?

Of course we do...  I am sure someone else will find it useful.
Just email Sam a copy privately  mailto:sbgolob@attglobal.net ,
XMIT PDS preferred, and it will be up at cbttape.org in a jiffy.
